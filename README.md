# Dan's own custom Bash happy helper functions

A bunch of helper functions I wrote to use for my own macOS terminal convenience. 

## WARNING USE AT YOUR OWN RISK (i.e. why are you running `source` on a stranger's shell scripts??)

(I only put these helper scripts on Github so I don't accidentally lose them when switching computers)


### Example installation

```sh
$ cd ~/Downloads
$ git clone https://github.com/dannguyen/bashappy_helpers.git
```

Example invocation in your `~/.bash_profile`:

```sh
source ~/Downloads/bashappy_helpers/main.sh
```
